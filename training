depression low selfworth is something ive struggled with for a long a i can remember it creates an incredibly unsafe place inside yourself where life begin and end at time the mania fuel your greatest idea give you hope for a better future you reach out to loved one you put yourself together and then creep in the loathing and fear that all of this is pointless you have no purpose no meaning but to be like this forever it a trap a cycle and if it tied up in the body it can feel like brick attached to muscle fiber we tell depressed people to exercise say affirmation and be around others these are great suggestion but only work to temporarily mask the pain instead what we should tell those who struggle with mental health issue is i see you because the reality is were smart we know this is not u we know what we must to do we know what life beyond the pain and negative thinking and we know it just a rollercoaster ride until the wave crash in towards peace again to see someone in their suffering go far beyond a white knight here to save the day it is much more simpler than that it is love it is love that guide u home every single time and to be seen by someonetruly seenis a gift originated from the heart if you fear you cannot give at all give one more time if we are here on this earth for anything it is to simplify the loving experience and depression is just a lie our brain tell u about what it all mean a depressed person doesnt feel unloved because of what is happening to them a depressed person feel unloved because of what is happening inside them that is why the saddest heart can wear the widest smile that is why the only way foreword is to constantly see the truth guide yourself back home today love and give once more mentalhealthawareness,1

one of the most common and widely believed misconception spread by apologist shill and carnists is that by advocating for animal liberation in a way that make people feel guilty or uncomfortable it push people further away from the cause in reality what brought u all to veganism is that we felt uncomfortable and guilty about the abuse we were responsible for demanding towards nonhuman animal nothing push people further away from a justice movement than being comfortable about committing injustice after all if people are comfortable enacting oppressive behaviour why would anyone even change so keep posting the vids on social medium keep telling those you speak to that veganism is the least we can do for animal and keep advocating fiercely forever and always for the victim slavery injustice oppression animalrights vegan antivegan psychology vegan whyvegan plantbased veganism govegan meat pizza food quote justicequotes veganquotes animalrightsquotes,2

if there anything i know for sure after spending 20 year in marketing it that people are primarily motivated by fear or love fear or love might be the undercurrent beneath another label stress passion hurt loyalty and so on but when you distill it down you can usually land on fear or love at the core when we act from a place of love there may be challenge but theyre often outweighed by the benefit joy flow and if were lucky pure bliss when we act from a place from fear we can feel stressed overwhelmed stuck angry agitated etc if youre in the latter state is there a mindset shift available to ease the stress can you look back at your life and think of time when stress wa a motivator painful definitely but perhaps a worthwhile challenge that proved to you what a tenacious badass you really are maybe it existed to show you what youre really made of where are you functioning out of love or fear right now what mindset shift are available to you in this moment theupsideofstress stressreduction motivation activation wellbeing wellbeingcoach wellness,1
