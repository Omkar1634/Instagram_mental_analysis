"I see lots of people arguing about when someone becomes a grown-up. It used to be around 25, but now some say it's closer to 30, and this has to do with how our brains develop.

The truth is, many adults still act like kids in some ways. This is a big problem in our culture. We often don't go through all the steps of growing up, don't have good role models, and struggle with handling our feelings as adults.

I had a moment when I was in my 30s, sitting on my couch, when I realized that I was emotionally still like a 10-year-old. I couldn't deal with problems or say how I felt, and I didn't even know what I needed.

I'm still working on becoming more mature emotionally. Being an adult is something that takes time and effort, being willing to do things that make you uncomfortable, and admitting that you need to grow up more.

What do you think about all of this?

"✨Depression & low self-worth is something I’ve struggled with for as long as I can remember. It creates an incredibly unsafe place inside yourself where life begins and ends. At times, the mania fuels your greatest ideas. Gives you hope for a better future. You reach out to loved ones. You put yourself together. And then creeps in the loathing and fear that all of this is pointless. You have no purpose. No meaning, but to be like this forever. It’s a trap. A cycle. And if it’s tied up in the body, it can feel like bricks attached to muscle fibers. 

We tell depressed people to exercise, say affirmations, and be around others. These are great suggestions, but only work to temporarily mask the pain: Instead, what we should tell those who struggle with mental health issues is…

“I see you.” 

Because the reality is… We’re smart. We know this is not us. We know what we must to do. We know what lives beyond the pain and negative thinking. And we know it’s just a rollercoaster ride until the waves crash in towards peace again. To see someone in their suffering goes far beyond a “white knight” here to save the day. It is much more simpler than that.

It is love. It is love that guides us home. Every. Single. Time. And to be seen by someone—truly seen—is a gift originated from the heart. If you fear you cannot give at all, give one more time. If we are here on this Earth for anything, it is to simplify the loving experience. And depression is just a lie our brains tell us about what it all means. A depressed person doesn’t feel unloved because of what is happening TO them. A depressed person feels unloved because of what is happening INSIDE them. That is why the saddest hearts can wear the widest smiles. That is why the only way foreword is to constantly see the truth.

Guide yourself back home today. Love and give once more. ❤️

"10th October was World mental health day! So it's worth celebrating it even though it's a bit late :)

Let's explore the impact of self judgement. There is no shame in having a flu or a sprained ankle but we worried about being judged  as weak or unstable when we face some mental struggle, so we bury our problems and keep on as nothing is wrong. But as we fear judgement from others we might also be judging ourselves. 
Not accepting our illness perpetuates our shame. Mindfulness teaches us that when we resist who we are, we are adding another layer to our struggles.
When we find acceptance for our struggles our relationship with illness begins to change, there is more compassion for the times we can't get out of bed, get to work, we become better listeners to when our body reaches its limits.

As Nayyirah Waheed said ""it's being honest about my pain that makes me invincible"" 

On this day as we contemplate our lives let's find a way to shine a little light on your struggles, be tender with ourselves, challenge ourselves, and find acceptance for the entirety of who we are.

"Our very first Empowerment Workshop ""You Are Enough"" took place last month. Twelve amazing women participated in a day of self-reflection and self-discovery. Some of the women knew one another and some had been to Spirit's Promise before for our grief groups. The day began with introductions, a mirror exercise and hurdles of self-discovery. 

The day was filled with laughter, and even a few tears, but the smiles at the end of the day were all I needed to see to know the day had been a success!

Our next ""You Are Enough"" workshop will be held on Sunday, October 22, from 11am - 3:30pm. This will be open to all adults (ages 18+) and we have added an extra hour.

"Do you Struggle with being Present? 

Staying present in the moment has been something I took for granted, understanding this concept has been transformative for my mental health. By being present my thoughts did not deviate away from the moment which in turn is a relief for my  anxiety and  brings peace ☮️ of mind 🧠 

What I am sayin is by focusing on one thing at a time you give that experience 💯 of your attention. It’s ok if it’s not perfect but being mindful of it helps when it’s not.

"Even though I only covered 4 miles today, it was still a great day, and met some awesome people!

A big shout out and thank you to Donald and Cindy here in the first pic! They were walking on the Promenade when they were walking by me and he read my sign that said “Walking Across America” and it caught his attention. We started talking for a few minutes and then it started raining and they turned around and walked back towards the hotel with me in the direction I was heading. I gave him my business card and he ended up going and getting a business card and a candy bar and a donation when we got to his hotel. They are from North Carolina and I hope to run into them when I’m walking up the East Coast! It was a pleasure meeting! God bless! Y’all  Matter!🙏
Next, we have Ruth and Ashley. Ashley, I posted a picture with last night and she works here at the Hillcrest Inn. Ruth is the owner of the Hillcrest Inn and the one who told me there was some people that wanted me to speak Thursday morning. Thank y’all so much, Ruth. This place is wonderful! God bless! Y’all Matter!🙏
After lunch with Tina, she ran me by the store, and while I was shopping, a lady was walking by the isle and said “you’re that guy,” and then I turned around looking for the guy she was talking about!😂 said that she has been following the journey and thank you for what I’m doing and I got a picture with her. God bless, You Matter!
Last, but not least, the funny, retired guy, who stopped me and was super proud of a shirt. I definitely thought there was gonna be a long conversation with him today, but it was a quick greeting, and a good laugh. Sir, You Matter!🙏
I took a couple pictures today, but nothing too much, it was some decent rain here and there when I was walking. But added 4 miles to the Journey today.

"It was World Mental Health Day on the 10th of October last week, which is why you’ve been seeing a lot of #mentalhealthawareness postings of the late.

Coincidentally, the past 3 months have been particularly challenging for me. Without divulging too much details, my responsible story says that I could have achieved so much more had I embraced the good and the bad that comes with life instead of thinking I’m always in control and when I’m not, it’s my fault for not preparing. 

And as I got professional help to strengthen my mindset, I realised all I had to do was to listen more to myself rather than needing other people’s opinion/validation. And it hit on me that’s how the folks at @acton.kl are educating their students there, with the guide shown on the back of their shirts. 

So for the rest of the entire 2023, I would love to seek your help my dear friends and family - just be there for me when I do reach out. For now, allow me to make my own choices with the kind of honesty I’m not even use to showing. Say no to me without fearing that you’re threading on egg shells. I don’t want to play the eccentric genius role anymore. I want to build good and honest relationships from now on. 

It’s going to be a scary ride, but I’m kinda excited to take this on between my 40s to 50s, and embrace the success and failures that’ll come along with it!

And I’m suspecting, it’s going to be freaking damn awesome ❤️🌟🤗😊

"Wonderful to be back with @ypo_sea Lion City Chapter last week exploring the Breath:Brain:Body connection and easy accessible ways to circuit-break acute and chronic stress states. 

A fabulous discussion on ‘good’ and ‘bad’ stress, common stressors and stress markers and we disbanded the big misconceptions around breathwork and meditation. 

We observed a real-time significant shift on screen as the group practiced a specific breathwork sequence that synchronises the nervous system. GOLD!

I am always excited to work with the vibrant and progressive YPO community. 

I am currently taking engagements for corporate workshops & keynotes for Q1 & 2 2024.

"Happy #WorldFoodDay 🎉🎉🎉 EAT FUN FOODS today and let that be your motto going into the new week, and for the rest of your life. Food freedom is something each and every person on this planet deserves and ALL foods are good and equal. 😋👍

Honestly, when I used to hear people and dietitians say that “all food is equal” and there are no good foods vs bad foods, in my head I would be like “yeah right” 😏😒 I never ever thought I would get to a place where an apple and a piece of cake would have the same value to me. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Fast forward to now, after I’ve done the work in recovery, rewired my brain, and recovered. I was making a grocery list yesterday and I put fruit on the list and then I put chocolate and muffins on the list. In my head I knew I needed to stock up on all groceries, but I wasn’t thinking that the sweets are “bad” and the fruit is “good”. It was just simply FOOD and food that I know my body NEEDS and will use for energy to live a full and happy life. 🥰

If you’ve been restricting your food or listening to diet culture, like I did for 20 years, it’s not always easy to see that diet culture is a complete brain wash. But once you recognize that diets simply don’t work, and that they actually make life miserable, you can jump in and start doing the work to rewire your brain, eat the foods you really want, and ditch diet culture FOREVER. Trust me, if I can do it - so can you! 😊🙌👊💥 xx 💋

"Imagine if we invested as much in building stronger support systems as we do as coming up with more “illnesses”. 

The strongest weapon against codependency is MORE emphasis on togetherness, not less. 

The narrative is falsely dominated by a culture of toxic individualism, which even/ especially the mentally health industry even propagates.

"You are the source of your own happiness. 

When you continue to look for others to make you happy, you will continue to look for happiness.

No one will be able to fill that void for you. Temporarily perhaps, but not long term.

Spend time finding what you makes you happy. What makes you, you.

Then true happiness is easier to find.

"Remember to give yourself credit and admire all that you have accomplished! 

You have so much to be proud of and deserve to celebrate yourself and your wins both big and small. This creates more positive moods and reduces feeling like you always need to be ""doing more"" and don't deserve pleasure. 

Here some ways to celebrate yourself 😊

💛 Reflect on and write down your accomplishments 
💛 Make a celebration music playlist to celebrate yourself 
💛 Invest in yourself! Treat yourself to something you have been wanting or invest in meeting with a financial planner or life coach. 
💛 Remind yourself that you ARE doing enough and celebrate that you have gotten through difficult times 
💛 Plan a self-care day 
💛 Practice accepting and receiving compliments 

Date CRÉDITO y ADMIRA todo lo que has logrado. Tienes mucho de lo que estar orgulloso y mereces celebrarte a ti mismo y tus victorias, tanto grandes como pequeñas. Esto crea estados de ánimo más positivos y reduce la sensación de que siempre tienes que estar ""haciendo más"" y no mereces placer. 

Aquí hay formas de celebrarte a ti mismo😊

💛 Reflexiona y escribe tus logros
💛 Haz una lista de reproducción de música de celebración para celebrarte a ti mismo
💛 ¡Invierte en ti mismo! Disfrute de algo que ha estado deseando o invierta en reunirse con un planificador financiero o un entrenador de vida.
💛 Recuérdate a ti mismo que ESTÁS haciendo lo suficiente y celebra que has superado tiempos difíciles
💛 Planifica un día de cuidado personal
💛 Practica aceptar y recibir cumplidos

Another batch of my absolutely delicious homemade organic & vegan gonna mostly be puréed detox and immune boosting soup.. 

Cabbage contains a chemical called sulforaphane, which helps the body fight against toxins. Cabbage also supplies the body with glutathione; an antioxidant that helps improve the detoxifying function of the liver.

Ginger is used in most detox programs due to its ability to “cleanse the body by stimulating digestion, circulation, and sweating. Its digestive actions may serve to cleanse the build-up of waste and toxins in the colon, liver, and other organs.

Turmeric also helps your body to detoxify by helping your liver to modify, inactivate and eliminate toxins and excess substances produced by the body.

Extracts of cumin seeds are rich in polyphenols and numerous other compounds that prevent oxidative stress inside your body. These not only detoxify the body by eliminating toxins from your system but also boost your immunity.

Saffron supports detoxification. It is a natural source of the antioxidant glutathione, which plays a role in helping your body to detox through supporting your liver – your body's main detox organ. In addition, glutathione leads to cell regeneration & a healthy gut. 

Hemp seeds have brain-friendly antioxidants & omega fats. Not to mention vitamin E, minerals & special fibre (called resistant starch) that is prebiotic & your gut bugs just looooove. Hemp seeds are one of the best plant-sources of protein. They also contain brain-friendly omega fats. 

Thanking you my Divine. Grace.

"Hot chocolate with a twist. Or just twisted. 😳

After a 4 hour long episode of brain fog this evening, mixed with a lot of agitation and followed by exhaustion, I decided to make several experiments with chocolate, peanut butter, dessicated coconut and cocoa powder. One of them was this weird-looking hot chocolate, yet pretty delicious enough to drink within 2 minutes. 

A tsp of cocoa powder, oat milk, approx 1 tsp peanut butter (or two?), definitely quite a few chocolate chips, lots of dessicated coconut and a lot of madness. Tadaa! Not sure about the quantity as the moment is quite blurry - I was on a high of brain fog agitation... 

Why this post? Again, breast cancer awareness month. For me it's not just about women - and men, checking their breasts. It's paramount of course. But it's also about trying to tell people that the consequences of a breast cancer diagnosis go way beyond the treatment. For some of us, many of us, the side effects of treatment, medication, induced menopause and so on can come and go with no warning, and sometimes be debilitating. Tonight the brain fog made me feel sluggish, like if I wasn't in my body, my cognition was definitely impacted, agitated, hilarious and I felt completely high. Let's not forget the hot flushes that came with it. Cancer really sucks.

"The MHWC's Statement for Carers

•	The MHWC acknowledges the carers, families and supporters as unsung heroes who provide care for people with a lived and living experience of mental illness and psychological distress – they are the bedrock of our community. 
•	The MHWC is committed to honouring and elevating the voices of carers, families and supporters and treating them with dignity and respect. We will work to reduce stigma and discrimination around mental illness and psychological distress that carers, families and supporters experience. 
•	We acknowledge the diversity of the caring experience and that it occurs in different cultural settings. This includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from culturally diverse backgrounds, people with disabilities including hidden disabilities, people with coexisting mental and physical health conditions, young people, older people, LGBTIQA+ people. We will respond to the needs of all carers in a trauma-informed, recovery-oriented, individualised way.
•	 The MHWC will work to ensure that carers are included in the care process, be aware of their rights, have access to information and support, and be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

"🌟 Did you know that October is National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month? 🌟

 Mental health is just as important as physical health, and this month serves as a reminder to prioritize our emotional well-being. Here are some interesting facts and tips to raise awareness about mental health screening:

1️⃣ Mental health screenings are a valuable tool for early detection and intervention. Just like we get regular check-ups for our physical health, it's essential to assess our mental well-being too.

2️⃣ Depression affects more than 264 million people worldwide, making it one of the leading causes of disability globally. However, with proper screening and treatment, individuals can lead fulfilling lives.

3️⃣ Mental health screenings are confidential, free, and easily accessible. Many organizations, clinics, and online platforms offer screening tools that can help identify potential mental health concerns.

4️⃣ Screening can help identify various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early detection allows for timely intervention and support.

5️⃣Mental health screenings are not only for those experiencing obvious symptoms. They can also be beneficial for individuals who may be feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or simply seeking to maintain their emotional well-being

"♠️ Once cancer is in your life, it never leaves ♠️ 

The first picture, glammed up me, the second picture, makeup free, exhausted me. Both me!

Even when a person has been through the hardest of battles and used every ounce of their strength to stay alive, come through it and beat cancer. Even when someone is declared “cancer free”. We are NEVER FREE. 

Yes we are alive and of course extremely grateful to be. But there is so much trauma. Trauma that is not seen or understood. It’s okay to not understand. But don’t forget what your friends and family members have been through. They may look and seem well on the outside but they are full of scars and damage on the inside. 

We are a different person now. And although we maybe physically well, mentally we may not be well. Or we may have life changing side effects from treatment. 

We are expected to be the person we were BC,  but we are not and we never will be. We have to get back to our jobs, be parents, wives, family members, friends and almost forget what has happened. But it’s not possible. It never will be. 

We don’t want sympathy, we want understanding. This post is to create awareness of the other side of cancer battles. Not just the hair loss, operations, tubes and sickness. 

Cancer changes lives and people forever.

I do swear I never intend my means of updating the collective to come with mass chaos, usually that chaos is from the chaos itself🤦🏼

REGARDLESS. I still cannot say how much my love for all is mutual. You needn’t “fly” of all things to see me of all people for any reason you just need approach me I do swear🤦🏼I’m only a riddle incarnate because not even I know my secrets.

"As two people inspired to make a difference in the world of mental health, we decided to start a series on Mental Health Mondays where we discuss and bring awareness to different disorders. If you would like awareness brought to a mental health issue, please message us and we will gladly help bring awareness to it. This week is anxiety awareness month, an issue that has impacted both co-founders of Mental Houseplants. Here is some of my anxiety story.

From as far back as I remember, I have always had anxiety. Anxiety disorder runs in my family so perhaps it is genetic, but it could have also developed from childhood trauma. Signs of anxiety disorder in myself include excessive worrying that didn’t seem to match the situations I was in. I was always feeling on edge, as if I was living day to day in flight of flight of fight. Because my mind was constantly racing with thoughts, I was also always tired, both physically and mentally. I’d often have a hard time concentrating due to racing thoughts and this would affect schoolwork or even conversations with friends. Sleep seemed impossible for me each night as my racing thoughts kept me awake or from staying asleep, resulting in being tired from day to day. Avoidance was another common anxiety symptom of mine. If certain people, situations, or places made me anxious, I’d avoid these. Another one was overthinking, where I’d ruminate too much or assume worst case scenarios. Lastly, constant reassurance was something I always needed to feel confident in myself or my choices. All these symptoms changed my perspective of myself and provided me with a lack of confidence in all aspects of my life. These symptoms can be overwhelming and exhausting to live with each day. It wasn’t until I sought after therapy and underwent cognitive behavior therapy that helped me learn how to think and see myself differently. For that, I am very thankful that I can live a happier and less stressful life. If this sounds like you, check out the resources we provided in this post.

"“Tente a la suerte quitando todo de mi vida.
Me adentré en lo profundo de mi ser buscando una respuesta para la realidad que ni yo misma asumía.
Dejé de mirar para al lado tratando de encontrar una salida, 
Me hundí en mi propia realidad.
Al levantar la cabeza, encontré lo más preciado que tengo, 
que siendo necia nunca me había propuesto ver.
Me encontré a MI
y ya no me perderé,
ya nunca….” Psm

Na nič sa v živote nehrám a myslím, že žijem disciplinovaný život s chuťou a snažím sa všade kde som vytvárať len positive vibes. Snažím sa brať život s úsmevom a dať vedieť ľuďom, že ich mám rád (česť výnimkam).

"Life is a journey filled with various experiences. While some of these moments are joyful and cherished, many memories are a mix of happiness and sadness. Even when we try to forget them, they tend to resurface and bother us. These experiences didn't just appear out of nowhere, they have been a continuous part of our life, much like the constant ebb and flow of a sea of tears. Even now, the profound realities of life remain concealed behind every word I speak. Let it all unfold.

Something for NIRVANA fans! Do you know what I’m talking about? First 3 pics = memorial in Aberdeen, the next one = memorial in Seattle, next 2 house and the neighborhood he lived in, the one after that is where he lived before fame and then the one where he died.

Suicide or Murder? 🤔

"I have to be honest with you…

I haven’t felt truly like myself for a while. I haven’t worked out in weeks, and I haven’t been in my normal routine. I’ve just been feeling out of it. 

To expect that these moments won’t ever happen is crazy, because we all go through these times in our own ways. Times that you don’t feel like yourself, and know that if you’re also going through one of these moments right now too - know you aren’t alone 🫶🏼

These moments are completely normal, and I don’t want you to think that it’s not. People on social media rarely show these, whether it’s moments of doubt, uncertainty, or whatever it may be. Nobody’s perfect - and instead of beating yourself up over it, try to understand why it could be happening in the first place. Maybe you’re starting a new job or chapter in your life, or maybe it’s what’s going on in the world. Whatever it may be, your feelings are valid.

Throughout these past few weeks, there have been a few quotes that I remind myself with to remember that these feelings and moments come and go. I’ve included them in this post for you to save if they also resonate with you too. I love you all, and know that you are never alone (my DM’s are always open xx) ✨

"I’ve associated so much of who I am with my identity as a teacher, a coach, an advisor that I am finding myself entangling a lot of sense of worth and lovability with “being inspirational”, or “being useful”.

I get to remind myself that I am loved for who I am, as I am - I am enough for who I am as I am.

Who I am is not defined by what I say, what I do, what I have or what I know. 

My beingness is enough.

So, is yours 🤎

"Surviving & certainly not thriving right now! 🤧🤧🤧

Sunglasses on in the house because my headaches are too intense to stand the light 😭

I've got the flu and feel like absolute crap! I've spent the last 2 days on the sofa, unable to leave the house or even get up for longer than 5 minutes without needing to lie down again. It's not fun at all.

My little one has started to show symptoms today, so I'm expecting a really rough few days. It's so hard looking after your children when you're sick. You just want to hide under the covers. But you can't. You've got to get on with the day. Because you are relied on. I've cried a lot from the pain and exhaustion, but doing my best to remind myself that this will pass.

Hoping it clears from our house soon. Please send healing vibes 😭🤒🤧

Bu insanlar, kendini daha güvende ve mutlu hissetmeni sağlar. Kendini ifade etmekte daha özgür hissedersin ve potansiyelini tam olarak gerçekleştirebilirsin.🌱
Hayatında böyle bir yer varsa, onu korumak için elinden geleni yap. Bu yer senin için bir sığınaktır ve sana güç verir. Eğer böyle bir ortamda olduğunu hissetmiyorsan, artık orada kalmak zorunda değilsin, unutma hepimiz her halimizle çok değerliyiz.🙌🌈

I work primarily with adolescents and adults struggling with anxiety, body image distress, eating disorders, depression, and life transitions. I am trained in EMDR and love treating trauma as well! 

When I’m not seeing clients, I enjoy spending time with friends, snuggling with my cat EmmyLou, playing my guitar, and cheering on the Atlanta Braves and the Tennessee Vols. 

My goal more than anything is to offer you a safe place to land in the midst of whatever you are going through. You don’t have to walk alone, and I’d love to come along for the journey.

New clients, I’d love to meet you! Visit the link in my bio to schedule an initial intake session.

Fellow therapists and healthcare professionals, I’d love to network! DM me and let’s get coffee ☕️

"I’ve always thought to myself that the brain is like a jigsaw puzzle, we are always trying to put the pieces together. 
I don’t often speak about mental illness on here, but I probably should since I do suffer myself. 
I’ve had attempts myself in the past, as well as having an eating disorder. 
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and PTSD, which stems from a lifetime of bullying in school, college, uni and the workplace. My last job role was hell, ironically I worked within mental health on a forensic ward. I was pushed out by staff members. I had one certain nurse call me fat. This was reported and they wanted me to have mediation, but I turned this down. I ended up going off sick for a year because my anxiety got so bad and luckily I was redeployed to a much better area. For awhile I thought I was the problem, but I’ve learnt I’m not at all. 
I’ve had multiple therapy sessions including EMDR, CBT, counselling etc, but I’ve found you have to put in the work and it can sometimes get overwhelming. 
If you’re ever struggling, please reach out to someone. My inbox is always open.

Some of my other pieces are just part of my own process of healing and self-care process. My hope is that these pieces help those recovering from mental health and substance use disorders remember the strength they possess in their own journey.

"Today is World Menopause Day. I did not know this when I woke up. But today has been a bit crappy. And I can’t even say why.

There are actually other people who a) have lost confidence on major roads and b) can’t drive over a flyover! I’m not alone 😃

"One of the most valuable things in life is to be surrounded by people who accept and support you for who you are. 🤗
These people make you feel safe and happy. You feel free to express yourself and you can fully realize your potential. 🌱
If you have such a place in your life, do your best to protect it. This place is a sanctuary for you and it gives you strength. If you don't feel like you're in such an environment, you don't have to stay there anymore. Remember, we are all very valuable in our own way. 🙌🌈

"Hi there ! 

Life has thrown me some curveballs recently, and I've been struggling with my own demons, especially the haunting effects of my PTSD. It's not easy, and there's particular challenge I've been dealing with - my abusive ex.

He's out there spreading lies, trying to paint me as the 'crazy' one and claiming he's done no wrong. It's taken tremendous toll on me, and I've kept this heavy burden to myself, only sharing It with my therapist and doctor.

You know, part of me wants to set the records straight, to finally tell my side of the story. But then doubt creeps in. After all the stories he's woven, would anyone even believe me anymore? Plus, there's the matter of our kids; I want to shield them from all the negativity.

I want you to know that I harbor no ill toward him. I simply long for the chance to move on with my life. Thanks for understanding and support through all of this. ❤️

"Psychologically speaking, effort is the activation of mental or physical power. It's a force that drives behaviour. Effort is often associated with something that can feel difficult and averse. People tend to avoid effort, including the effort from merely thinking things through. 

The brain constructs the perception of effort based on: 

-The current physical effort that is elicited

-Previous experience with a similar effort

-Motivation

-Awareness

-Affects

Effort can be less aversive and sometimes even rewarding through learning of conditioned associations with reward.

"While grief is a natural response to loss, it can be a challenging and complex emotional journey. Grief Counseling can provide the tools, guidance, and support individuals need to navigate this journey more effectively and ultimately find a path toward healing and resilience.  When we don’t allow ourselves the time and space to process and heal from our grief it is at a risk of becoming ‘Complicated Grief’. Unlike normal grief, which tends to gradually improve over time, complicated grief is marked by its persistence and the depth of its impact on a person's emotional and psychological well-being. You are at risk for complicated grief if you have little social support, the loss was unexpected/tragic, you have preexisting mental health conditions, or you depended highly on the person you lost. Grief counseling provides a supportive and therapeutic environment where individuals can work through their emotions and navigate the complexities of grief.

"As you embark on your journey through self-healing and self-awareness you must get more intentional about who you allow into your life and the places you treasure. The more you grow is the more you will see the importance of guarding your peace and your energy because one wrong choice can throw you off your A game and mess up all the work that you're doing to keep improving your life.... Maturity is painful and growth stems from experiences.

So become more intentional about your business partnerships, your friends, your life partner, the kind of work you do, your purpose in life.... Think about those aspects of your life that are important for your overall wellbeing and protect them from others and even yourself if necessary.

Working with Joe, helped bring me clarity, focus and accountability, and I now know where I’d like to be and what I’d like to achieve. Joe used a range of helpful techniques and exercises with me, to really hone in on what I wanted out of my business and life, and her friendly and approachable manner meant I always felt safe, heard and understood in our sessions. Thank you so much Joe for the incredible sessions together; I now feel empowered and equipped to deal with whatever comes my way.""

"Its OK To Not Feel Ok

This past month I have felt such a wave of motivation and momentum.

Everything I am doing feels exciting and I love the feeling it's giving me.

I have set so many exciting goals and business is better than ever.

Funnily, it has come off the back of one of my toughest periods.

A period when I lost love for a lot of things.

A period where every day, getting out of bed was such an effort.

A period where I was living for the weekend, an escape in social nights out.

I am not writing this post to tell you how I got motivated again…

That will come later.

I am writing this post to tell you it's ok to not feel great.

Most people probably don't realise this…

But I go through a lot of ups and downs mentally.

You wouldn't know it from my social media.

Don't get me wrong, I hope you don't take this to think I am fake.

It's the opposite.

I am always trying to show both sides of the coin.

Because you know what, it's absolutely ok to not always be thriving.

Without the lows we wouldn't appreciate the highs.

It's ok to go through periods where not all your actions are what you'd like them to be.

What I will say is this…

I never play the victim.

When I do go through these periods I have compassion for myself…

But I also take ownership and draw a line under it.

We write our own narrative and its only us that can change the story.

No matter how bad I feel I never let my poor behavior get too far.

For me, it's all about percentages.

If I am doing the things that are aligned to my values and beliefs MOST of the time…

And I am feeling driven, motivated and happy MOST of the time…

Then that's a life I can live with and be proud of.

"It is said that people who fall in love with endurance sports often do so because of the feeling of overcoming something. 

It fills that hollow feeling. It scratches that itch. You sort of hate it but have learned to love it. You crave the fulfillment and seek it often. 

Your highs are high, but your lows are also - because you continue to get out there and trust the process. You know that your willpower and determination got you where you are and will carry you through if you stick with it. You feel strong, unstoppable.

Sometimes you cross that finish line feeling excited, proud, standing tall. And sometimes you’re cold, tired and disgusted that your prize is a slice of pizza and a ticket for a free beer. You reflect on your months of training and question if this is it. 

C’est la vie. You don’t do it for a prize. You do it for you.

With one half-marathon under my belt, I dialed in my training and took immense care of my body the weeks leading up to race day. I slept well, ate well, and practiced reducing stress. I cut sugar from my diet and did all the self care. 

Did it work? ABSOF***INGLUTELY! 

I PR’d with a 2:04 - a whopping 10 minute difference from my first half in April. Proud? Yes. Defeated? Also yes. 

Will I do it again? ABSOF***INGLUTELY

كل فرد وكل سن وكل جنس قادر تجيه نوبة هلع، كاين لي تجيهم خطرة في العام وكان حالات اخرة تجيهم 2 3 في اليوم او كل يوم، وهاذو الحالات يقدر يتطور لهم اضطراب الهلع او panic disorder .
نوبات الهلع عندهم علاقة مع القلق و stress، ولكن même تجوز نهار شباب بدون اي قلق تقدر تجيك نوبة هلع وهذا عندو علاقة تاني مع عوامل اخرى، يعني اذا مرقدش مليح، مكليتش مليح ونتا راك خدام وكاين ضغوطات، لتم قادر تجيك نوبة هلع.
كاين بزاف طرق باش تتعامل مع نوبات الهلع وللأسف مكاش حاجة تحبسهم وتوقفهم للأبد لأن العوامل الخارجية والصدمات لي يصراونا منقدروش نتحكمو فيهم.

"Teaching kids mindful eating is a valuable skill that can help them develop a healthy relationship with food, make better food choices, and prevent overeating. Mindful eating encourages children to be more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations when they eat.

Remember that mastering this skill is a gradual process. Be patient, and don't expect them to grasp the importance of this immediately. The goal is to help them develop a lifelong healthy relationship with food and eating 🌷✨

"One of my favorite adaptogenic herbs is Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) 🌿



Swipe right➡️ for a couple of examples from my personal “Farmacy” - this is what I’ve been taking:



☀️During the day I might take 200-400 mg 

🌛In the evening I take 250mg in a combo with L-theonine and other adaptogens and antiinflammatory herbs (TBH sometimes I forget 😳)



Ashwagandha has a long list of benefits  Benefits:



✔️Stress reduction and building resilience and stamina 🧘🏽‍♀️


✔️Mental health 🫶🏽: showing improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms


✔️Cognitive function 🤓: studies suggest that ashwagandha may support cognitive function, including memory and attention.


✔️Neuroprotective properties 🧠: potentially safeguarding against neurodegenerative conditions


✔️Anti-inflammatory effects 🔥: contribute to overall health, supporting both physical and mental well-being.


✔️Improved sleep 😴 some studies suggest it may support sleep quality



Dose recommendations vary for each person and the purpose, but most research suggests that to see the benefits someone needs to be taking 250–600 mg per day for at least 1 month.

For most, it’s been shown to be safe at higher doses (but it’s good to talk to your herb-savvy healthcare professional for personalized guidance before going rogue 👩🏻‍⚕️). 



👉🏽 Anyone else been using a lot of ashwagandha these days??

✨️ What other herbs do you love for supporting mental health?

"Друзі, сьогодні про інформаційного партнера конференції і партнера наших багатьох проєктів для організацій!
Громадська організація “Психологічна підтримка та реабілітація ""Вільний Вибір”” працює у сфері ветеранських справ з 2015 року.

""Наша місія – це надання психологічної підтримки ветеранам, ветеранкам, військовим та їх родинам у доказових методах психотерапії. 
Ми робимо усе можливе, аби творити та розвивати екологічну, професійну спільноту фахівців сфери ветеранських справ. 
Від початку заснування ми надали більше 6 тисяч індивідуальних консультацій ветеранам та ветеранкам, а також членам їх родин. З них – майже півтори тисячі консультацій лише за останні 6 місяців цього року.

Провели приблизно 150 груп підтримки для родин загиблих військовослужбовців протягом  2022-23 року.
Щомісяця наші фахівці надають приблизно 250 індивідуальних консультацій. Ми робимо все можливе і неможливе, аби розширювати команду та мати змогу закрити більшу кількість звернень.

Наші проєкти: 
Створили мобільний застосунок «База»  для психологічної підтримки ветеранів та ветеранок. Доступний до завантаження безкоштовно в Google Play та App Store. Його мета – допомогти ідентифікувати стани та віднайти вправи для самодопомоги. Це не заміна психотерапії, але шанс краще зрозуміти, що з тобою відбувається та допомогти собі, коли накриває. 

Щоб мати змогу охопити більшу кількість запитів, ми проводимо лекції про ментальне здоровʼя за донат. До вебінарів доєднуються і колеги зі сфери - Олександр Авдєєв, Ольга Кухарук, Євген Пілецький, Володимир Станчишин.

Також ми створили посібник «Інтервізія для психологів», в якому розповіли про інструмент інтервізії для саморозвитку, профілактики вигорання та підтримки спеціалістів. Крім цього, проводимо тренінги для підтримки колег.

Один із останніх проєктів – це комунікаційна кампанія, яку розпочали разом з платформою для онлайн-терапії Hedepy. Називається «Подаруй підтримку тим, хто захищає»  і має на меті запропонувати всім охочим підвісити психологічну консультацію захисникам або задонатити будь-яку суму для її проведення.
"
"Our feelings can sometimes betray us. Not because I feel like ""not loving you today"" means that I should act on that. Love is a choice. Remember the commitment you made to each other that day at the altar ""for better or for worse"". This means, I choose to love you even on those days that you are at your worse. Choose to Love -and love well.

"Feeling stressed? Here are 10 ways to de-stress and improve your mental well-being:

1. Exercise regularly. Physical activity is a great way to reduce stress hormones and improve your mood. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.

2. Practice deep breathing. Deep breathing is a simple but effective way to calm your mind and body. When you're feeling stressed, try taking a few deep breaths from your diaphragm. Breathe in slowly through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth.

3. Seek social support. Talking to loved ones about what you're going through can help you feel less stressed and more supported. 

4. Practice mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation is a practice that involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. This can help you to reduce stress and anxiety, improving your overall well-being.

5. Engage in hobbies. Spending time on your hobbies is a great way to relax and de-stress. Do something that you enjoy and that makes you feel happy.

6. Set boundaries. Don't be afraid to say ""no"" when you need to. Healthy boundaries protect your mental well-being.

7. Get enough sleep. When you're well-rested, you're better able to cope with stress. 

8. Take regular breaks. Schedule breaks into your day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Get up and move around, step outside for some fresh air, or do something else that you enjoy.

Taking care of yourself is essential for managing stress and improving your mental well-being. Try these tips to de-stress and improve your overall well-being.

"The Two-Week Wait (TWW) can be a rollercoaster of emotions for anyone on a fertility journey. It's that anxious period between ovulation and the potential confirmation of pregnancy.

Here are a few tips to help you not only cope but thrive during this challenging time:

1️⃣ The TWW can feel like an eternity, so use this time to de-stress with self-care. 

2️⃣ Knowledge is empowering. Learn about your body, reproductive health, and the science behind conception.

3️⃣ Reach out to friends, family, or support groups who can empathize with your experience. Sharing your feelings can lighten the emotional load. 

4️⃣ Don't hesitate to consult a healthcare professional or fertility specialist for guidance tailored to your situation

Remember, you are strong, resilient, and capable of handling whatever comes your way. Your path to parenthood is unique, and you've got this! 💪❤️

You’re not throwing money at your ‘problem’ to have someone else solve it.

When you choose to invest in yourself you’re not investing in the ‘thing’ you think is going to deliver your transformation at your feet.

You’re investing in yourself to create your unique transformation.

It means you’re showing up & taking yourself more seriously.

And doesn’t it feel good to take yourself seriously?

Doesn’t it feel good to trust yourself and know that you are the one who’s going to make your dreams come true? 

And wouldn’t it feel good to take positive action toward your goals knowing you have your best interest at heart?

"St. Anthony was called the “father of monks,” and of the Desert Fathers who lived in the Egyptian desert. They knew, as Henri Nouwen writes, that “solitude is the furnace of transformation. Without solitude we remain victims of our society and continue to be entangled in the illusions of the false self.” Nouwen writes that “Anthony and his fellow monks considered it a spiritual disaster to accept passively the tenets and values of their society.”

"Hey everyone 💚

Its been a super busy six months and I am finally taking the opportunity in November to go away for some time off in Athens, Greece with my wonderful partner Joe.

I havent been as active on social media recently because I've become very conscious of how much social media takes me away from the present moment. So I am trying to find a balance and work out a way of still providing you with valuable content when I can.

There have been a few changes happening in the way that I work this last month and taking some away will be really help me to create some space to evaluate what I want to bring forward.

This will help me to bring to you new offerings -expanding on what I offer, alongside some of the work changes I am going through. Again watch this space!

Also....I'd love to share more with you my interest in choosing Athens as a holiday destination..for those of you that love history and mystery... If you know me, you know I am fascinated by ancient mysteries and civilisations. Having studied Anthropology, it very is very much a reflection of this! 

I am interested in the lost knowledge of our ancestors and what they understood about life, death & divinity. The work of Brian Muraresko is deeply fascinating and I recently discovered the work of @Apostolia Papadamaki at Medicine festival - an ancient Greek wisdom keeper. 

It is interesting how meeting the right people, learning and journeying into sound healing has led me to learning about the Sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidaurus, Greece - a sacred place used for ceremonial medical practices as far back as the 2nd millennium BC. 

Its all synchronicity, and when we tune into all these connections in life do we realise that maybe we have been here before? Maybe the discovery is here to show us the power and healing knowledge we all have inside of us.

"Hello every plushie 

We started the stop plushie stigma campaign and we have been blown away by all the reposts, comments and support so thank you. 🤗

A few people also asked why did we start this campaign, so I’d like to tell you. 

We started this campaign because we want to stop the stigma and help people but also because my mummy loves and has always had plushies and that will never change!! 

When mummy was little she was treated very badly and plushies was literally all she had to make her feel safe 
And now for the past almost 20 years I have been by her side everyday!! 

Through amazing times such as our adventures to really bad times such as very close family member deaths etc that left her with PTSD. 

I am Mummys best friend in the world, she loves and trusts me, I make her feel safe, and she shouldn’t be mocked for having a plushie because she needs one, even when out, but sometimes she is and so are others and that is not right!! 😡

So that’s why we started this campaign to 
Stop plushie stigma and show that a plushie can make a difference because I am and will continue too just as all plushies help their humans. 🧸🧸🧸
 
So can I please ask my plushie friends to repost our photo, to show support to ending the stigma of plushie love? 

🛑🛑🛑🛑 Please share the above photo, 
Use the # 
#stopplushiestigma 
And say why plushies are important to you, 
And don’t forget to mention me in your post as this is my protest. 🛑🛑🛑🛑💙🧸

Also if you wish to help my campaign further I have a GoFundMe! page so please donate if you can. 

Please help us end plushie stigma. 🩵🤗

"Some conditioners, as well as pomades, volumizers, and styling creams, contain oils or waxes that can clog pores and create acne, especially on the forehead, the back, and the hairline. Even if you're careful to avoid getting them on your skin, they can run down your face and body as you shower and when you sweat, or be transferred by your pillowcase while you sleep.

"PSYCHOLOGY FACT
Mirror Neurons: Mirror neurons in the brain allow us to empathize with others. When we see someone experiencing an emotion, our brain mirrors that emotion.

Multitasking: Despite the common belief in multitasking, our brains are not designed for it. Multitasking can decrease productivity and increase stress.

Confirmation Bias: We tend to seek out and remember information that confirms our existing beliefs, which can lead to biased thinking.

The Power of Music: Listening to music you love can instantly change your mood and reduce stress. It has a significant impact on our emotions and can even trigger vivid memories.

"Life is full of highs and lows...you can't feel one without having felt the other.
Some people may seem to have more highs than others, and that could be a reflection of the opportunities that life has given them and their personal circumstances....you can't change the cards life deals you, but you can change the way you react to them and that is where your worth should come from!

"Mental Health Nugget 6:Practicing Gratitude

Taking a moment each day to reflect on what you're grateful for can improve your mental health. It shifts your focus from what's lacking to what's present and positive in your life. Consider starting a gratitude journal to record the things you appreciate, no matter how small. This practice can foster a more positive outlook and reduce stress.

"Mental health is not a niche concern; it is a universal aspect of human life that affects us all in some way. Raising awareness about mental health issues and mobilizing efforts to support mental well-being should be a shared responsibility. By breaking the silence, challenging stigma, and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, we can create a world where everyone has the opportunity to lead a mentally healthy life. It's time to prioritize mental health as a fundamental part of our collective well-being and take action to make a positive change.

"“Back then, the telltale signs of OCD were raw hands from hand washing. I did exhibit more overt or stereotypical symptoms, like rechecking if the stove was turned off, or making sure a door was closed. But even those symptoms, I didn't know were a part of my OCD.

Ultimately, the most paramount source of torment was the intrusive thoughts. I was constantly fighting them, and I had no idea that this was making them even stronger. Many days, I would go to school and work with an anxiety-drained body. It just took a lot out of me. 

I ended up missing out on a lot of things because the anxiety and the bullying led to depression and isolation. I mean, I just couldn't function. Things went on like that for nine years until I graduated high school in 92. 

…I know I'm not the only one that has suffered for a great length of time, and there's no telling how many others are out there that are misdiagnosed. 

I connect with people on Facebook and in OCD groups, and some people are really struggling to find a therapist. Some are scared to disclose their thoughts. Some won't go to therapy, even knowing that these thoughts have a name and that there's treatment — they're still scared to death to go. 

It is just the most torturous disorder. I mean, no disorder is good, but OCD is especially torturous. It robs you of joy. It robs you of peace. It robs you of life. It takes any and everything from you, and doesn't give anything back. It's just a vicious disorder. 

But my advice is to get into treatment as soon as possible anyway, because it does work. Your life's at stake, but you don't have to suffer. You can get your life back.”

Chase is an OCD advocate who has been an active member of the Made of Millions community for the past couple of years. To thank him for his support, we sat down to learn more about him and his OCD journey. Link in bio to read the full piece 🔗✨

"Hi, it’s me🙋🏼‍♀️

I have a few new followers so I thought I would introduce myself and share more about myself…

I’m a mum to 5 beautiful children, one teen boy and four girls. 

We all love to travel 🧳 
When I say travel, I mean ALL TRAVEL..
From a lovely winter weekend in Center Parcs to big road trip’s around the US. 

Some surprising things you may not know about me from what I post on my page…

1. We are trying to live a full life and we want to enjoy all the things of life. We have recently took our retail business from a premises to all online which we hope will give us more quality time with kids and more freedom to travel 🙌🏽

2. I home educate two of our children. I’m a firm believer school isn’t for every child. The schooling system has let my children down. 

3. The reason I set this travel page up was because I now work less but I still wanted to do something for myself. I enjoy working but supporting my girls at home is now my priority. This page helps keep me sane and I enjoy content creating. 😍

4. People are often surprised that I actually suffer from severe anxiety which stemmed from having postnatal depression with my last baby. Having something to always plan helps keep my mind busy. Weirdly, it’s rare I have anxiety about upcoming trips or travelling with my large family. I have a fear of heights and fast rollercoasters and I have to work really hard not to pass that onto my kids and so far all my children are massive thrill seekers so what I’m doing is working 🙌🏽

"🎨Emotions Through Art 🎨

Grandma Linda put on an emotional art session yesterday 🫣 Most of our kids act out when their emotions become too much so to combat that she had them paint what they felt right at that moment 😌 
Giving the kids an outlet without having to say anything seemed to help them convey things they might’ve never said 😏
This is amazing improvement and great for mental health battles some kids face 👍🏽

"Tears are often misunderstood as a sign of weakness. They arise from moments of raw emotion, genuine laughter, deep sorrow, and overwhelming joy. They tell us of love lost, lessons learned, battles fought, and memories cherished. 

In a world that frequently urges us to 'stay strong' or 'hold it together,' it's essential to remember that embracing our tears is an act of self-awareness and healing. We're allowing ourselves to confront our vulnerabilities and, in the process, find our strength. 

So the next time tears threaten to spill, let them.

"Understanding Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):

Seasonal Affective Disorder, commonly known as SAD, is a form of depression that typically occurs during specific seasons, most often in the fall and winter months. This condition is closely linked to reduced exposure to natural light, which can disrupt our body's internal clock and affect our mood. 😞

❓ What Are the Key Symptoms of SAD?
- Persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness
- A noticeable loss of interest in activities
- Fatigue and increased need for sleep
- Changes in appetite, particularly craving for carbohydrates
- Difficulty concentrating and making decisions

☀️ Why Does SAD Occur?
The exact cause of SAD isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to a combination of factors, including:
- Reduced exposure to sunlight, leading to imbalances in the body's natural rhythms.
- Changes in serotonin and melatonin levels, affecting mood and sleep patterns.
- Genetic predisposition, as SAD tends to run in families.

🌱 Managing SAD:
- Light therapy: Exposure to artificial light that mimics natural sunlight can help alleviate symptoms.
- Psychotherapy: Talk therapy can provide valuable coping strategies.
- Medication: In some cases, antidepressant medication may be prescribed.
- Lifestyle adjustments: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule can make a difference.

Remember, SAD is a real and treatable condition. If you or someone you know is struggling with these symptoms, don't hesitate to seek professional help. There's hope, and brighter days are ahead! 🌞💙 #MentalHealthMatters #SeasonalAffectiveDisorder #SADAwareness

"Finally Badrinath 🙏❣️

We reached Badarinath late  night, had dinner and tried to sleep. But it was so so cold and had put on our thermal wear, socks, blankets to keep ourselves warm.
Thermal wear, jackets, gloves , caps was mandatory. 

Early morning we headed towards Badrinath temple. We had to walk for 1.5 kms to reach the temple. We had the most divine darshan here. Me and prakash voluntarily swept inside the temple premises after we saw a couple of them doing so.

Badarinath or Badarinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu. It is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. Badrinath is located at an elevation of around 3,100 m. Located in the Garhwal Himalayas, on the banks of the Alaknanda river, this sacred town lies between Nar and Narayana mountain ranges. . The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu—holy shrines for Vaishnavas—who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan region
The temple is believed to have been established by sage Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century. With Lord Vishnu as its presiding deity, the temple remains open for six months in a year. In winter it becomes inaccessible due to heavy snowfall.
It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers and one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.

"Just a reminder for you lovely people...

I spent so long being so hard on myself for any mistake I made. From dating the wrong guy to overfilling the kettle. 🤦‍♀️

But once my self-talk shifted to compassion, the need to criticise myself faded. 🩵

There are so many reasons our inner critic has been or still is so constant for some of us. But the blunt truth still remains...

You need to change the way you talk to yourself. 

I promise you with time, awareness (to catch yourself) and dedication, to speak more lovingly to yourself, your mind will shift, and this wonderful habit will just be automatised 🩵

According to WebMD, “more students are dealing with depression than those of previous generations “ and “college is a common time for many people to experience the first signs of depression.” Here are coping mechanisms to help overcome symptoms of depression from the NHS website. #wellness #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #namipiedmonttricounty

"In light of domestic violence awareness month, here are some warning signs of abuse. While this list is not an exhaustive list and some signs may be more noticeable than others, domestic violence can look different in different relationships. Some of these signs can change throughout the course of the relationship. 

No one deserves to experience abuse of any kind for any reason at all.

"The dialogue on mental health is always depicted as a before and after. 

The narrative is always something along the lines of “I used to struggle with depression/anxiety/insert mental health issue, but then I asked for help or started taking meds, and now I’m okay”.

And I want to both honor that, and critique it. Because for so many of us managing mental health issues, that narrative isn’t really accurate. For many of us, we understand that our mental health will never look like a before and after. Rather, we will always reside somewhere in the space in between.

Because, for many of us, mental health management is just that: a continuous process of managing our mental well being.

It’s not black and white. It’s not as simple as “okay” or not. It’s not as easy as this “get help and get healed” narrative that’s given to us.

It’s a nonlinear process.

There are set backs. There’s growth. There are mistakes. There’s side stepping. There’s doubt. There are learnings. There are ups and downs and twists and turns.

So, if you’re currently in the middle of managing your mental health:

I want you to know I see you. I honor the space you’re in. Your dedication to being here is brilliantly courageous. 

It’s okay if you have a bad day. It’s okay if you fuck up. It’s okay if you feel like you’re taking steps backwards instead of always moving forward.

You are allowed to live in multitudes. You are allowed to exist with duality.

No matter where you are in your journey- You are enough, you’ve always been enough, you will always be enough— and I’m happy you’re here. The world wouldn’t be the same without you.

"Being YOU is the greatest gift you can give yourself & humanity. The more you step into YOU, the more beautiful life will become. You came here with a purpose, not to follow someone else’s path or vision of what or who you should be. All transformation starts with one step.
 
Here is a good place to start:
 
♥️Establish rituals and routines that bring you in alignment
 
♥️Find your people – they always show up at the right time
 
♥️Do things to raise your vibration – dance, sing, play, ground
 
♥️Start listening to your body and quietening the mind
 
♥️Explore! Try new things and see what feels right
 
♥️Slow down, create space, to just BE & listen
 
♥️Be open & be willing to let go of old stories and ways of being
 
Breathwork & cold immersion are amazing practices to incorporate in your pursuit of becoming YOU. DM me if you’re interested in booking a session.

2. 🧠 Improved Mental Health: Therapy can help manage anxiety, depression, and more. Your mental well-being is worth the investment.

3. 🙌 Self-Discovery: Gain insights into yourself, your behaviors, and your goals. Discover the power of self-awareness.

4. 🌬️ Stress Relief: Learn techniques to manage stress and find your inner calm.

5. ❤️ Better Relationships: Communication skills and emotional intelligence get a boost, improving all your connections.

6. 💪 Resilience: Overcome trauma and develop the strength to face life's challenges.

"As we continue to share the unique pastime hobbies of first responders, we would like to highlight Zachary Fernandez. 

Zachary has been a firefighter since 2015 and always knew that he wanted to become one. Before he was a firefighter, Zachary worked in the construction industry. After he made the career transition he purchased a home with the goal to fix it up. The home he ended up purchasing did not need much work, so Zachary decided to channel his creativity and make the furniture for his home. This sparked his passion for woodworking. Zachary has found that woodworking is a form of therapy and helps to keep his mind off of things. He recognizes the positive impact of his hobby and encourages other first responders to incorporate a hobby in their free time as well.

"It’s been a minute since I’ve updated this page, and I wanted to reintroduce myself to the new faces around here! 👋🏼 

My name is Laura and I’m a mental health counselor with Melton Wellness Group based in the East Nashville/Inglewood area. I work primarily with adolescents and adults struggling with anxiety, body image distress, eating disorders, depression, and life transitions. I am trained in EMDR and love treating trauma as well! 

When I’m not seeing clients, I enjoy spending time with friends, snuggling with my cat EmmyLou, playing my guitar, and cheering on the Atlanta Braves and the Tennessee Vols. 

My goal more than anything is to offer you a safe place to land in the midst of whatever you are going through. You don’t have to walk alone, and I’d love to come along for the journey.

New clients, I’d love to meet you! Visit the link in my bio to schedule an initial intake session.

Fellow therapists and healthcare professionals, I’d love to network! DM me and let’s get coffee ☕️

"I’ve always thought to myself that the brain is like a jigsaw puzzle, we are always trying to put the pieces together. 
I don’t often speak about mental illness on here, but I probably should since I do suffer myself. 
I’ve had attempts myself in the past, as well as having an eating disorder. 
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and PTSD, which stems from a lifetime of bullying in school, college, uni and the workplace. My last job role was hell, ironically I worked within mental health on a forensic ward. I was pushed out by staff members. I had one certain nurse call me fat. This was reported and they wanted me to have mediation, but I turned this down. I ended up going off sick for a year because my anxiety got so bad and luckily I was redeployed to a much better area. For awhile I thought I was the problem, but I’ve learnt I’m not at all. 
I’ve had multiple therapy sessions including EMDR, CBT, counselling etc, but I’ve found you have to put in the work and it can sometimes get overwhelming. 
If you’re ever struggling, please reach out to someone. My inbox is always open.

"Today is World Mental Health Day 🤍

Often the people struggling the most don’t say anything… they don’t talk about how they feel through shame or feeling like a burden. When you ask if someone’s ok… ask them TWICE. 

In a world where social media is bigger than ever we can confuse what happiness is and where we need to be in life to feel ‘happy’. 
What we see on the surface isn’t always what it seems. 

Be kind, talk to strangers, compliment people, smile more, think twice before you say something that may be hurtful. 

On my toughest days, things that made a difference to me was kindness from others and people who took the time to listen and not judge. 

It’s ok not to be ok ❤️

"Happy #worldmentalhealthday I’ve been on medication for my mental illness for 12 years and I’m still here because of it. Check in with people and genuinely do more than text them once a year asking if they are ok on corporate events. Learn about their conditions, make spaces available and accessible for your friends. And don’t judge they’re stronger than you think #mh #mi #mentallillness #endthestigma #neurodiverse #cptsd #bpdawareness

"spiritual warfare is more common than you might think. We tend to think of demonic oppression as wild and crazy things happening in our life. But actually, the reality of spiritual warfare in our lives happens more often than we might think. The devil attacks the mind and begins to twist thoughts and perspective in order to bring confusion. Satan's mental attacks cause a person to be paralyzed in his thought life and left bewildered. But there is a way to defeat the enemy during this time:
🤎PRAYER
🤎DO NOT FORGET WHO MADE YOU
🤎PUT ON THE ARMOR OF GOD
🤎MEMORIZE SCRIPTURE 
🤎SEEK HELP IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY 
we are in this together bestie 🙏🏽 we want to help you are not alone.

"Title: The Madhouse 🖼 
Year: 1808/1812
Author: Francisco Goya 
Description: Scene depicting the chaos of the madhouse experience. Naked men grapple with each other or with invisible deities. Chiefs and kings represent authority figures that easily suggest the horrifying power dynamics in 18th century asylums.
Medium: oil
Location: Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid 🇪🇸

"One of the most common and widely believed misconceptions spread by apologists, shills, and Carnists is that by advocating for animal liberation in a way that makes people feel guilty or uncomfortable, it ""pushes people further away"" from the cause.

In reality, what brought us all to veganism is that we felt uncomfortable and guilty about the abuses we were responsible for demanding towards non-human animals.

Nothing pushes people further away from a justice movement than being comfortable about committing injustice.

After all, if people are comfortable enacting oppressive behaviour, why would anyone even change?

So keep posting the vids on social media, keep telling those you speak to that veganism is the LEAST we can do for animals, and keep advocating fiercely... forever and always, for the victims!

"Австрия и цифровой мир
⠀
Одна из интересных и неожиданных особенностей Австрии - это внезапный вайб 80-90-х, который здесь ощущается.
⠀
От телефонных кабинок на улицах до номеров факсов на сайтах, от характерного (отсутствующего) дизайна до любви к ретро и винтажным вещам.
Порой я иду по улице и очень явственно чувствую, что как будто перенеслась назад во времени. Мне как будто вернули мой 2007.
⠀
Здесь слушают радио и носят любимые свитера по двадцать лет, игнорируя массмаркет. Здесь много дерева и натуральных материалов. Кружевные занавески на окнах, старая мебель, бумажные письма, отсутствие видео-рекламы и бигбордов на улицах.
Здесь никуда не спешат и считают личным оскорблением просьбы о переработках. Выходные проводят дома, стригут газоны, дружат с соседями, любят ездить в горы в домах на колесах и кататься на велосипедах. Здесь практически нет электросамокатов (к счастью) и совсем нет стремления к показной, нарочитой роскоши и понтам.
⠀
Это как если бы сейчас был 98-й год, только с мобильными телефонами и интернетом.
Даже я, человек с трином Урана к Луне, обожающий гаджеты и интернет, обнаружила, что в разы маньше времени стала проводить в сети и в компьютерных играх, на которых я выросла и в которых прожила, пожалуй, пару лет игрового времени.
⠀
Так влияет на людей в том числе карта страны. Это очень интересно с точки зрения астрологии.
Представьте себе цветные линзы - в зависимости от сочетаний цветов мы получаем усиление и ослабление разных оттенков. Так же пересекаются и натальные карты людей с картами стран.
⠀
В карте Украины Уран чрезвычайно важный объект, чуть ли не половина планет в Водолее. И цифровизация в ней идет полным ходом - от документов до банков - всё онлайн.
⠀
В карте Австрии Уран в квадрате к Солнцу и упр. гороскопа и здесь очевидно огибают вопросы сверх-технического прогресса и скоростные эволюции. А существование  интернет-банкинга - скорее ультра-трендовый бонус, чем обычное дело.
⠀
Безусловно, эра Водолея ощутима и здесь. Но она не нарушает тепло и некое очарование этой винтажной атмосферы фильма конца 90-х годов.

"Mutlu günler 🌿

Günlük yaşamda erteleme davranışları ile sıklıkla karşılaşabiliyoruz. Pek çoğumuz kendi yaşamımız başta olmak üzere günlük hayatta ‘yarın konuşurum..., ay başında kursa yazılırım…’ gibi erteleme cümleleri ile karşılaşmışızdır değil mi ? 

Bu erteleme davranışı bazen zorunlu gündelik şeyler için bazen de isteğe bağlı yapılacak şeyler üzerine olabiliyor. Ertelenen şeyler bazen çok büyük hedef ve planlar olmamakla birlikte bir arkadaşımıza söylemeyi ihmal ettiğimiz bir sözcük bile olabilir. Bu davranışın nedenleri kişiden kişiye değişebilmekle birlikte zorunlu spontane durumlar dışında bazen özgüven, motivasyon eksikliği, mükemmelliyetçilik, kaygı ve stres gibi psikolojik nedenlere bağlı olabiliyor. Bu ertelemeler ile yaşamımız daha karmaşık ve zorlu hale gelebilmektedir. Bu durumda bu davranışın nedenleri ve yaşamımızda ne sıklıkta meydana geldiği ve yaşamımızı nasıl etkilediğini dikkate almak önemli olacaktır. 

Yapmayı istediğimiz güzel plan ve sorumluluklarımızı ertelemeden kolaylıkla gerçekleştirebilmeyi diliyorum. 🍀

"In the race for more, we often miss the beauty in simplicity. Being poor isn't just about not having much, but about always wanting more, a hunger that can never be satisfied.

Deep within the person who constantly craves, there's a never-ending emptiness, a thirst that can't be filled by just having more stuff. 

So Seneca reminds us that real richness comes from appreciating what we have now, being thankful for the good things in our lives. Being happy with what we have is the real treasure, the secret of finding wealth in being satisfied with just enough.

"PSYCHOLOGY FACT
Mirror Neurons: Mirror neurons in the brain allow us to empathize with others. When we see someone experiencing an emotion, our brain mirrors that emotion.

Multitasking: Despite the common belief in multitasking, our brains are not designed for it. Multitasking can decrease productivity and increase stress.

Confirmation Bias: We tend to seek out and remember information that confirms our existing beliefs, which can lead to biased thinking.

The Power of Music: Listening to music you love can instantly change your mood and reduce stress. It has a significant impact on our emotions and can even trigger vivid memories.

"Cris de détresse

Dans une pièce vide et froide, tout ce que vous entendrez en retour c'est l'écho qui singe vos malheurs.
.
Laissez entrer, dans cette pièce, les personnes que vous aimez, vos amis, votre famille.
Les cris de douleurs se transformeront en éclats de rires et de bonheur.

"Se ci si apre e non si é accolti, o capiti, la sferzata é forte, la battuta d'arresto stordente, ma non per questo dobbiamo mutilare la nostra voce e ciò che da noi viene.
E non pensate che essere terapeuti sia immunità da questa o da altre cose, eguali o peggiori.
Io, spero, di usare sempre bene il vostro splendido idioma italiano (la lingua dei nobili e dei diplomatici di un tempo,boa lingua che scelse Mozart per le sue opere) con annesse tutte le parole radicate nell'esattissimo e funambolico  latino e nel geniale quanto visionario greco, ma anche io non vengo capito, o frainteso, o  travisato, o tradotto nell'animo altrui male.
Ma potrei rendermi muto? O negarmi le parole per dirMi e per darMi? Io già che poi tanto non parlo, che a cinquanta anni mi pare ancora che sto orientandomi su questo pianeta, che non ho pretese perché non mi sento in diritto di chiedere figurarsi di ricevere, che nel privato la mia voce la odio quasi quanto il mio volto e corpo, e che sempre preferisco ascoltare, con reverenza.
L'Analisi é una vaccinazione verso certi dolori o difficoltà della vita, quando torneranno si starà male - poco o tanto - ma non se ne morrà.

"//🎙️ch.20. | part 1 finale.
with @rodneyperrylive 

the healing power 
of laughter in 
challenging times.

In this chapter of the crown podcast, we are joined by Comedian Rodney Perry, a legend who has appeared on stages around the world giving his own brand of comedy that many have emulated. Rodney is well known for being the co-host of the Monique show, the movie Madea’s Big Happy Family and has appeared in countless other movies in various roles including Coming to America 2. 

In this chapter, Steve Whyte | @iamstevewhyte speaks with Rodney Perry about his journey from his perspective. From being friends with and mentoring some of the biggest stars in comedy such as Eddie Murphy, Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, Kevin Hart, and Katt Williams, to more humbling experiences such as overcoming a stroke and Covid, Rodney has a message that transcends comedy, the highs, the lows, bereavement, health, connection and the healing power of laughter.

A safe space where you can breathe again.

"If the touchy-feely relationship isn’t for you and you find yourself attracted to unavailable people, you may have an avoidant attachment style. 

Oftentimes, this stems from being in an emotionally unavailable environment as an infant. It either wasn’t safe to express emotions or you learned to be self reliant. 

With avoidant attachment, as with many things, it’s important to slowly work towards feeling secure in relationships and at a pace that works for you. 

Here are some tools:
✨ practice naming and feeling your emotions
✨ communicate your needs for space and independence before shutting loved ones out
✨ try expressing your needs 
✨ give yourself grace and compassion to overcome self-reliance
✨ slowly challenge your independence in ways that feel safe to lean into intimacy 

Remember, posts are not a substitute for mental health services or therapy, but simply serve to educate and act as a guide.

"The quote ""The greatest of all sins is to think oneself weak"" is attributed to Swami Vivekananda, a renowned Indian philosopher and spiritual leader. He was a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world in the late 19th century.

This quote is a reflection of Swami Vivekananda's teachings on self-confidence, inner strength, and self-realization. He believed in the inherent divinity and power within each individual and encouraged people to recognize and harness their inner strength. According to Swami Vivekananda, considering oneself weak or lacking in confidence is a significant obstacle to personal growth and spiritual development. Instead, he advocated self-belief and the realization of one's true potential as a means to achieve success and spiritual fulfillment.

This story is about friendship of four girls;

- Diana yang bisa memahami orang lain dengan melihat awan tak kasat mata yang ada di atas kepala mereka

- Elsa yang bisa melihat kebohongan dan niat jahat orang lain lewat segelas air.

- Kinna yang bisa melihat nasib baik dan nasib buruk melalui kupu-kupu tak kasat mata.

- Dan Rura yang bisa berbicara dan memahami bunga, entah secara langsung maupun secara batin. 

Dan kisah mereka ini dirangkum dalam sebuah novel fantasi yang berjudul, ""Four Ladies of Praiser"" dan bagi kalian yang punya Wattpad, silakan search dan baca ya!^^

"«Μόνο τα παιδιά μου με νοιάζουν» 
«Για εκείνα δε φεύγω» 
«Είναι η μόνη μου χαρά»

Εμείς φροντίζουμε το παιδί μας γιατί εκείνο είναι ότι σημαντικότερο έχουμε..
ξεχνώντας ότι για εκείνο πάλι .. είμαστε εμείς. 

Αν ως γονιός δεν προσεχείς τον εαυτό σου, ζώντας μέσα στην ανοχή και την υπομονή,  θα το συναντήσεις στον αυριανό θυμό του παιδιού σου. 
Όχι για το πώς συμπεριφέρθηκες σ εκείνο. 
Αλλά για το πώς συμπεριφερθηκες στον εαυτό σου.

كل فرد وكل سن وكل جنس قادر تجيه نوبة هلع، كاين لي تجيهم خطرة في العام وكان حالات اخرة تجيهم 2 3 في اليوم او كل يوم، وهاذو الحالات يقدر يتطور لهم اضطراب الهلع او panic disorder .
نوبات الهلع عندهم علاقة مع القلق و stress، ولكن même تجوز نهار شباب بدون اي قلق تقدر تجيك نوبة هلع وهذا عندو علاقة تاني مع عوامل اخرى، يعني اذا مرقدش مليح، مكليتش مليح ونتا راك خدام وكاين ضغوطات، لتم قادر تجيك نوبة هلع.
كاين بزاف طرق باش تتعامل مع نوبات الهلع وللأسف مكاش حاجة تحبسهم وتوقفهم للأبد لأن العوامل الخارجية والصدمات لي يصراونا منقدروش نتحكمو فيهم.

"Teaching kids mindful eating is a valuable skill that can help them develop a healthy relationship with food, make better food choices, and prevent overeating. Mindful eating encourages children to be more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations when they eat.

Remember that mastering this skill is a gradual process. Be patient, and don't expect them to grasp the importance of this immediately. The goal is to help them develop a lifelong healthy relationship with food and eating 🌷✨

"Anksiyete, yaşamın doğal bir parçasıdır. Bu duygu, genellikle belirsizlik, stres veya tehlikeli durumlar karşısında ortaya çıkar. Ancak, anksiyete kontrol dışı hale geldiğinde ve günlük yaşamı olumsuz etkilediğinde sorun haline gelebilir. Anksiyete, bedenin savaş ya da kaç tepkisini harekete geçirir, bu da kalp atışlarını hızlandırma, nefes almayı derinleştirme ve kasları gerginleştirme gibi fizyolojik tepkilere yol açabilir.

Anksiyete bozuklukları, bu reaksiyonların sürekli ve aşırı olması durumunda ortaya çıkar. Panik ataklar, genel anksiyete bozukluğu ve sosyal anksiyete bozukluğu gibi farklı türleri vardır. Bu durumlar profesyonel yardım gerektirebilir. Tedavi, psikoterapi, ilaçlar veya bu ikisinin bir kombinasyonunu içerebilir.

Anksiyete ile başa çıkmak için faydalı adımlar arasında derin nefes almak, gevşeme tekniklerini öğrenmek, düzenli egzersiz yapmak, sağlıklı bir yaşam tarzını sürdürmek ve destek sistemlerinden yararlanmak yer alır. Anksiyete, tedavi edilebilir bir durumdur ve kişinin yaşam kalitesini önemli ölçüde iyileştirebilmek için başa çıkma yöntemleri öğrenilebilir.

Anxiety is a natural part of life. This emotion typically arises in response to uncertainty, stress, or dangerous situations. However, when anxiety becomes uncontrollable and negatively impacts daily life, it can become a problem. Anxiety triggers the body's fight or flight response, leading to physiological reactions such as increased heart rate, deepened breathing, and muscle tension.

Anxiety disorders manifest when these reactions are constant and excessive. There are different types of anxiety disorders, including panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. These conditions may require professional help for management. Treatment can involve psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of both.

Effective strategies for coping with anxiety include deep breathing, learning relaxation techniques, engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and utilizing support systems. Anxiety is a treatable condition, and learning coping mechanisms can significantly improve a person's quality of life.

"س: ماهية الارطوفونيا وما هو دور المختص الارطوفوني ؟
ج: إن الارطفونيا تهتم بدراسة وعلاج اضطرابات اللغة والكلام والصوت مهما كان سن المريض ( سواء كان صغير السن ام كبير )  وسبب الاضطرابات ( سواء اعاقة سمعية ام بصرية ، حادث أثناء الولادة، وراثة ...) 
 اما بالنسبة لدور المختص الارطوفوني يُعد دوره  مهم وأساسي في مرافقة أولياء الأطفال اللذين يعانون من اضطراب لغوي، ذلك لأن الكثير من الآباء لا يُجيدون التصرف حيال الصعوبات اليومية التي تواجههم في عملية التواصل مع أبنائهم، من أجل ذلك ترتبط المرافقة الأرطفونية بنوعية المشاكل المتعلقة بطريقة الأولياء في التواصل مع أبنائهم المضطربين، -ولابد أن تتوفر في المختص الارطفوني شروط كالذكاء ,الثقة بالنفس ,أسلوب التعامل مع المريض والتنويع في أساليب وتقنيات العلاج .أما الاضطرابات التي يعالجها المختص الارطفوني فتتمثل في الاضطرابات اللغوية سواء أكانت شفهية كتأخر الكلام أم مكتوبة كعسر القراءة,بالإضافة إلى اضطرابات اللغة الناجمة عن الإعاقة السمعية الخلقية والمكتسبة,آو الاضطرابات الناجمة عن إصابات دماغية ,وأيضا اضطرابات الإنتاج الصوتي واضطرابات اللغة لدى المصابين بالأمراض النفسية والنفس –الحركية والعقلية

"Acupuncture will help you get to so much better 
Better sleep
Better energy
Better mental clarity 
Better body temperature (good bye hot flashes)
Better grounding in your body

"Tylko czy zaburzenia lękowe WYGLĄDAJĄ?
Nie zobaczysz ich gołym okiem, nie dotkniesz, nie dowiesz się jaką mają strukturę.
Nie są namacalne. 
One są w głowie, zatruwają cały Twój organizm, wyniszczając każdą komórkę. 
Każda podjęta walka z nimi jest jak walka ze swoim najgorszym demonem. 
Zakładamy maski nie dlatego, żeby kogoś okłamywać, a po to, żeby uniknąć pytań, na które sami często nie znamy odpowiedzi. 
To też nie jest tak, że to dzieje się ciągle, ale rzadko kiedy obca osoba będzie w stanie zauważyć zmianę, która się w nas dokonuje. 
Jeśli ktoś długo ze mną przebywa to jest w stanie to wyłapać.
Najczęściej co się dzieje? Nagle robię się poddenerwowana, rozdrażniona, bo najzwyczajniej w świecie mam ochotę uciec, ale nie wiem dokąd. I mimo tego, że zwykle udaje mi się ukryć nawet to rozdrażnienie, to i tak czasami wymyka się to spod kontroli. Czasami trzęsą mi się ręce albo ciężej oddycham, bywam, że muszę wyjść od towarzystwa do łazienki się rozpłakać, wtedy jedynie po oczach można rozpoznać, że coś się dzieje. Jednak jeśli ktoś ma świadomość tego z czym się zmagam, to nie zadaje pytań, a ja to bardzo doceniam. 
A jak to wygląda u Ciebie?

"Est-ce que tu savais que le/la Naturopathe s'appuie sur 10 piliers afin de renforcer, soutenir et stimuler l'énergie vitale de la personne et renforcer le pouvoir d'auto-guérison du corps ? 😌

🍃 Les piliers 3 majeurs sont l'alimentation, le mouvement et la gestion du stress.

🍃Les piliers mineurs sont l'utilisation des plantes, l'hydrotherapie, les techniques respiratoires, les techniques manuelles, les techniques énergétiques, les techniques vibratoires et les techniques réflexes (coucou la réflexologie plantaire 🥰👋🏻)

💡Il y a donc toujours une solution !  Et c'est tellement gai de pouvoir renouer avec des techniques de soin ancestrales comme l'hydrotherapie (bains dérivatifs, bains de siège, douche écossaise) et la phytothérapie, par exemple.

Vous aviez conscience de tout ça ?☺️

"I’ve associated so much of who I am with my identity as a teacher, a coach, an advisor that I am finding myself entangling a lot of sense of worth and lovability with “being inspirational”, or “being useful”.

I get to remind myself that I am loved for who I am, as I am - I am enough for who I am as I am.

Who I am is not defined by what I say, what I do, what I have or what I know. 

My beingness is enough.

"Surviving & certainly not thriving right now! 🤧🤧🤧

Sunglasses on in the house because my headaches are too intense to stand the light 😭

I've got the flu and feel like absolute crap! I've spent the last 2 days on the sofa, unable to leave the house or even get up for longer than 5 minutes without needing to lie down again. It's not fun at all.

My little one has started to show symptoms today, so I'm expecting a really rough few days. It's so hard looking after your children when you're sick. You just want to hide under the covers. But you can't. You've got to get on with the day. Because you are relied on. I've cried a lot from the pain and exhaustion, but doing my best to remind myself that this will pass.

Hoping it clears from our house soon. Please send healing vibes 😭🤒🤧

Therapy isn't just about talking—it's about transforming your life. Here are a few reasons why therapy can be a game-changer:

2. 🧠 Improved Mental Health: Therapy can help manage anxiety, depression, and more. Your mental well-being is worth the investment.

3. 🙌 Self-Discovery: Gain insights into yourself, your behaviors, and your goals. Discover the power of self-awareness.

4. 🌬️ Stress Relief: Learn techniques to manage stress and find your inner calm.

5. ❤️ Better Relationships: Communication skills and emotional intelligence get a boost, improving all your connections.

6. 💪 Resilience: Overcome trauma and develop the strength to face life's challenges.

7. 🛤️ Personal Growth: Set and achieve goals, one step at a time.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and work on yourself.

An diesem Vormittag geht es 4 Stunden nur um Selbstfürsorge. Es geht um sich einkuscheln, sich um sich selbst kümmern, genießen, spüren, fallen lassen und vor allem achtsam in den Tag zu starten.
In einem geborgenem Rahmen tauchen wir ein in eine  Yin Yogasequenz und in das Reich der Achtsamkeit hinein. Du bekommst Tools an die Hand die dir in deinem Alltag helfen können. 
Begleitend wirken Räucherungen und das Wissen darüber.  Ein gemeinsames Essen rundet den

"Todays collective energy card for air signs: Gemini, Aquarius and Libra. #empress tarot. 

Balanced masc/fem energy. Energy of nurturing, Mother Earth, feminine energy fertility and creating. 

Whenever this card shows up, you can connect with all aspects of your femininity, she relates to abundance in all areas of her life. She is connected with peace. 

I always have a #selfcare spa experience on these days and I make it a point to chill, connect with nature in some way and give thanks for abundance…

"Le Baume balsem voor lippen en droge huid.

Een echte must have! ☔️🌧️🌨️❄️

Vegan! 🌱

De wind en kou zijn niet heel vriendelijk voor je lippen en kwetsbare, droge gedeeltes van je huid. Omdat je lippen geen talg produceren, hebben ze geen natuurlijke bescherming. Ze moeten niet alleen gehydrateerd worden, maar ook hersteld en gevoed. Een balsem voor je lippen is dus een must. En niet alleen voor je lippen: ook andere kwetsbare delen van je gezicht kunnen soms wel wat hulp gebruiken van een verzorgende balsem (zoals bij vervelende verkoudheden en loopneuzen).

"I absorb other people's emotions. 
 Something I've tried to do is check in with my baseline emotions. Then try to  notice if that baseline shifts or changes when another person enters the room/or shares something etc.  Once you’re able to identify a shift from your baseline, you can ask yourself: Is this feeling mine, or someone else’s? If it's not yours- Let it go! Remember if it isn't yours, you don’t have to take it on.

"I can not begin to tell you!

Just how amazing I'm feeling right now!

Honestly it's like a switch has gone off and it's no longer dark, there is a light there, and it's getting brighter each day.

Today.. I have helped a gorgeous lady save some money on daily essentials!
I've welcomed a new team member to Team Ignite!
Received two of the three books I ordered myself and I can not wait to read them.  That will be another post 😁!

The feeling you get when a new Team Ignite member is added is just warm, butterflies, excitement and confidence boosting!
Same feelings of knowing that you have helped someone save money, with them getting their daily essentials at a discount cost.

I feel all cosy with those feelings and added comfort of my hoody too!

I just love being able to support others and I can not wait to support more.

Would you like to have these feelings for you too?
If so then we can have a chat.

"#WellnessWednesday

Small, positive changes add up and make a difference.  You are far more likely to keep habits that make you feel better than ones that don't. But if a habit isn't making you feel good even though it should be a positive, check-in on the thoughts behind it that are bringing you discomfort or unhappiness.  It may not be the habit change, it may be the thoughts.

"🇪🇸Mira dentro, haz instrospección. Tras esas barreras que te has puesto hay crecimiento, prosperidad, belleza. ¿A qué te aferras? ¿Qué estás permitiendo que te bloquee? Mira más allá. Manifiesta tus deseos.¿Qué miedo tienes, que crea una muralla a tu alrededor y no te permite dirigirte con determinación hacia un nuevo lugar? ¿Es quizás aprender a hablar de tus deseos, sentimientos y preocupaciones sin miedo al resultado y sin miedo a perder? ¿Será lanzarte a descubrir qué es lo que realmente te llena, lanzarte hacia cosas nuevas, dejar viejos y obsoletos patrones atrás?  Independízate de aquello que te hace miserable, no tengas miedo al fracaso. Hay un camino lleno de maravillas justo en frente de ti.

🇬🇧 Look inside, reflect. Behind those barriers you've build for yourself, there is growth, prosperity, beauty. What are you holding on to? What are you allowing to block you? Look beyond. Manifest your desires. What type of fear creating a wall around you and preventing you from heading, with determination, towards a new place? Is it perhaps learning to speak about your desires, feelings, and concerns without fear of the outcome and without the fear of loss? Is it about starting a venture to discover what truly fulfills you, embrace new things, and leave old and outdated patterns behind? Free yourself from what makes you miserable, don't fear failure. There's a path full of wonders right in front of you.

"//🎙️ch.20. | part 1 finale.

the healing power 
of laughter in 
challenging times.

In this chapter of the crown podcast, we are joined by Comedian Rodney Perry, a legend who has appeared on stages around the world giving his own brand of comedy that many have emulated. Rodney is well known for being the co-host of the Monique show, the movie Madea’s Big Happy Family and has appeared in countless other movies in various roles including Coming to America 2. 

In this chapter, Steve Whyte | @iamstevewhyte speaks with Rodney Perry about his journey from his perspective. From being friends with and mentoring some of the biggest stars in comedy such as Eddie Murphy, Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, Kevin Hart, and Katt Williams, to more humbling experiences such as overcoming a stroke and Covid, Rodney has a message that transcends comedy, the highs, the lows, bereavement, health, connection and the healing power of laughter.

A safe space where you can breathe again.

"#WednesdayWellness⠀
Embarking on the pathway of breast cancer treatment is indeed a journey of bravery and resilience. Amidst this journey, oral health might seem like a small detail, yet it couldn't be more critical. Why? Because some treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation, can impact your oral wellness, leading to symptoms like mouth sores, dry mouth, or increased susceptibility to infection.⠀
We're here to equip you with essential oral care tips to guide you through this journey:⠀
😁 Shielding Your Smile: Brush your teeth gently but thoroughly at least twice a day, using a soft-bristle toothbrush and a fluoride toothpaste.⠀
🧵🪥 Daily Flossing: Incorporate gentle flossing into your daily routine — it's your first line of defense against potential infections.⠀
💧 Sweet Relief: Combat dry mouth by sipping water throughout the day, and sucking on ice chips or sugar-free candies to stimulate saliva production.⠀
🪥Embrace Gentleness: Avoid abrasive oral care products and opt for alcohol-free mouthwash to safeguard against dry mouth.⠀
👨‍⚕️🦷 Regular Check-ins: Schedule regular appointments with your dentist — they can provide personalised advice and help manage any oral complications promptly.⠀
🥗 Mindful Nutrition: Maintain a balanced diet, rich in vitamins and minerals. It not only boosts your immune system, but also promotes oral health.⠀

"Klantenbeoordeling 🙏

🌳 Mijn leven stond lange tijd in het teken van de zorg voor mijn vrouw met de ziekte van Alzheimer. 

Tijdens het bosbaden voelde ik nieuwe energie, waarvan ik dacht dat die nooit meer terug zou komen. 

👣 Ik was meteen op mijn gemak, kon ontspannen en merkte dat mijn gedachten minder druk waren. 

Dit was een verrassend aangename ervaring.

💚 Dank je wel, Sigrid. 

Ik kijk ernaar uit om de volgende keer weer met je mee te gaan.

Luc 🥰

"MENOPAUSE AWARENESS DAY 🥰

Sharing open conversations over tea, biscuits and plenty of cold juice was exactly the remedy today. 

Taking a moment after school today to share experiences of the menopause, give insights and also learn from others, was a great success. Staff were able to relax with members of the well-being team and talk freely about the menopause. 

If you haven’t already done so, please take a moment to listen, read or talk about the menopause.

"Participation in regular physical activity can increase our self-esteem and can reduce stress and anxiety. 
It also plays a role in preventing the development of mental health problems and in improving the quality of life of people experiencing mental health problems.

"If there’s anything I know for sure after spending 20 years in marketing, it’s that people are primarily motivated by fear or love. 

Fear or love might be the undercurrent beneath another label: stress, passion, hurt, loyalty, and so on. But when you distill it down, you can usually land on fear or love at the core.

When we act from a place of love, there may be challenges, but they’re often outweighed by the benefits joy, flow, and, if we’re lucky, pure bliss.

When we act from a place from fear, we can feel stressed, overwhelmed, stuck, angry, agitated, etc. 

If you’re in the latter state, is there a mindset shift available to ease the stress? 

Can you look back at your life and think of times when stress was a motivator? 

Painful, definitely. But perhaps a worthwhile challenge that proved to you what a tenacious badass you really are. Maybe it existed to show you what you’re really made of. 

Where are you functioning out of love or fear right now? What mindset shifts are available to you in this moment?

"Sweat equity.

We have all heard the phrase before but, have you really stopped to think about what it means? 

Equity is defined in the dictionary as “the quality of being fair and impartial”
Pair that with sweat and make it make sense 🤔

For me, it’s a commitment to myself to be fair and impartial to both my mental and physical health. Sweat doesn’t discriminate. No matter who you are, effort results in sweat. That effort may look different for each of us but, we all share the same sense of accomplishment and pride. 

I challenge everyone to have a sweaty day, as many days as you can. Physical activity can do wonders for our physical and mental well being, and is readily available to each of us. All it takes is your effort to earn that sweat equity 💪🏼💦

What’s your favorite way to sweat it out? I think mine is pretty obvious 😌

"Hey amazing moms! 🌸 Let's talk about something important today: self-doubt. It's okay to feel uncertain, especially when you're juggling the joys and challenges of motherhood. But remember, you are not alone in this journey. Here are some empowering steps to help you overcome self-doubt and prioritize your well-being:

1. Acknowledge Your Struggles: Embrace your vulnerabilities; it's the first step toward empowerment.

2. Challenge Fixed Mindsets: Believe in your potential to grow and change. You are capable of evolving!

3. Redefine 'Me Time': Self-care doesn't have to be elaborate. Find small moments for yourself in your daily routine.

4. Build Healthy Habits: Start small and be consistent. Every positive choice adds up to a healthier you.

5. Boost Your Confidence: Celebrate your strengths and achievements. You are stronger than you think.

6. Seek Support: Don't hesitate to ask for help. You don't have to face challenges alone.

7. Embrace the Journey: Becoming a healthier, happier you is a process. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

Moms, you are incredible, resilient, and capable of overcoming self-doubt. Taking care of yourself isn't selfish; it's essential. You deserve happiness, confidence, and good health. Here's to embracing the transformative journey toward self-love and self-discovery. You've got this! 💪❤️

"Just a reminder for you lovely people...

I spent so long being so hard on myself for any mistake I made. From dating the wrong guy to overfilling the kettle. 🤦‍♀️

But once my self-talk shifted to compassion, the need to criticise myself faded. 🩵

There are so many reasons our inner critic has been or still is so constant for some of us. But the blunt truth still remains...

You need to change the way you talk to yourself. 

I promise you with time, awareness (to catch yourself) and dedication, to speak more lovingly to yourself, your mind will shift, and this wonderful habit will just be automatised 🩵

"Est-ce que tu savais que le/la Naturopathe s'appuie sur 10 piliers afin de renforcer, soutenir et stimuler l'énergie vitale de la personne et renforcer le pouvoir d'auto-guérison du corps ? 😌

🍃 Les piliers 3 majeurs sont l'alimentation, le mouvement et la gestion du stress.

🍃Les piliers mineurs sont l'utilisation des plantes, l'hydrotherapie, les techniques respiratoires, les techniques manuelles, les techniques énergétiques, les techniques vibratoires et les techniques réflexes (coucou la réflexologie plantaire 🥰👋🏻)

💡Il y a donc toujours une solution !  Et c'est tellement gai de pouvoir renouer avec des techniques de soin ancestrales comme l'hydrotherapie (bains dérivatifs, bains de siège, douche écossaise) et la phytothérapie, par exemple.

Vous aviez conscience de tout ça ?☺️

"Did you know that experiencing menopause alongside an existing ADHD diagnosis or symptoms may lead to unique challenges? 

ADHD symptoms can evolve with age and hormonal changes, such as reduced oestrogen levels during menopause, which can impact these traits.

If you’re facing this dual challenge, here are some recommendations:

1. Maintain a symptom diary to monitor your daily well-being.

2. Have a conversation with your GP about hormonal changes. If you’re already on ADHD medication and encountering signs of menopause, it may be necessary to adjust your treatment plan.

3. Embrace a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, which can significantly aid your well-being.

4. Prioritise rest; quality sleep is crucial for concentration and minimising brain fog. Additionally, consider mindfulness and meditation practices.

5. Seek the guidance of a therapist who can assist you in managing your symptoms and emotions during this phase. They can help you develop effective coping strategies, set goals, and identify triggers while also offering support networks. If needed, professional help such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can be instrumental in understanding triggers and developing coping skills.

"😫𝑰𝒏 𝑷𝒂𝒊𝒏 ?

Pain is an awful debilitating thing which leaves you not only in varying degrees of discomfort, but also lacking energy, short fused, exhausted and tense! 

It is often a result of major stress and things being off kilter or out of balance. 

Sometimes there are bigger things going on in the body, that need addressed, and not just the site of the pain point physically. 
Yes, we can definitely address the site, but often there is more behind it in the background.

By looking at the body as a WHOLE, taking an HOLISTIC APPROACH, we can find better, longer lasting solutions and not only reduce the pain, tension and inflammation, but much more energetically.

We can stimulate circulation, increase hydration, look at nutrition and inflammatory markers, look at the emotional pain, overwhelm and a range of other ‘pain points’ whether that’s physical and/or emotional stressors and create more stability and less pain.

If you’re fed up with not getting to the root cause on anything going on in the body, it is definitely time to dig deeper and address what’s really going on…

"It's #WorldMenopauseDay, and with this year's focus on Cardiovascular Disease, here are Be Military Fit's top five tips to keep your heart healthy, happy, and strong:

1️⃣ Conquer Cardio:  Get your heart pumping in Be Military Fit sessions, from boot camps to intense workouts, to boost cardiovascular health with a military-inspired twist.

2️⃣ Fuel Up with Intent: Eat mindfully - lean proteins, whole grains, and nutrient-packed foods that fuel your heart and body for your training challenges.

3️⃣ Focus on Strength: Get stuck into into resistance training; it's not just about fitness, it's about military-grade strength that fortifies your heart and body.

4️⃣ Harmony in Mind: Equip yourself with stress-busting tactics - military style. Our workouts aren't just physical; they're mindful resilience practices designed to bring balance and keep stress at bay.

5️⃣ Strength in Monitoring: Think of your regular Be Military Fit sessions are moments of self-reflection. A chance to check in and monitor your fitness progress as you conquer every challenge thrown your way with a combination of resilience and a mindful approach to your well-being.

Join our welcoming Be Military Fit community, where we simply see menopause as a new stage of empowerment and every step, as a stride towards a healthier heart, stronger body, and more vibrant life.

Sie hat einen angstlösenden Effekt und kann bei jeglicher Anspannung verwendet werden. Wir schätzen diese Pflanze sehr und haben sie deshalb zusammen mit Hopfen, Melisse und Lavendel in unsere Take it Easy Mischung integriert. Eine wunderbare Kombination für dein Nervensytem ☘️🥇

"When 'Brompton Babies' are born they are sometimes unable to feed for several days/weeks immediately after birth, or for a while after surgery/procedures. Many mums will express breast milk during this time and it is stored in the ward fridges/freezer. 

To help parents take any excess milk home once they have been discharged from the hospital we provide them with very special insulated 'Brompton Cool Bags' to safely transport excess bottles of breast milk for when it can’t be used straight away. This means it can be taken home and frozen until baby is ready.

Just one of the many ways we provide support for our young patients and their families ❤💙

"🙋‍♀️Navigating Perimenopause and Menopause?

Are you or someone you know entering this life-changing phase? Here’s what to expect and how to thrive.

Recognizing the Key Signs and Symptoms:
🩸 Irregular Periods: Hormonal fluctuations can make your menstrual cycle unpredictable.
🔥 Hot Flashes: Sudden waves of heat accompanied by sweating.
😢 Mood Swings: Hormonal changes can impact your emotional well-being.
💧 Vaginal Changes: Reduced estrogen levels can lead to dryness and discomfort.
😴 Sleep Disturbances: Night sweats and insomnia might affect your sleep.
❤️ Changes in Libido: Hormones can influence your sexual desire.
🦴 Bone Health: Decreased estrogen increases the risk of osteoporosis.
❤️ Cardiovascular Health: Hormonal changes may impact your heart health.

The Transition into Menopause:
Menopause officially begins when you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. Many of the symptoms experienced during perimenopause continue into menopause, and there are also long-term health considerations to keep in mind.

embrace the change with confidence. 💪💕

"Dancing is healing ✨️ Qigong in dancing is something I find very special because it is supporting health and wellbeing, and at the same time, it is so much fun and joy that makes the whole process enjoyable and lovely💗

We start the class with a grounding meditation, healing sounds of shamanic drums and other instruments, then, we continue with a Qigong warm-up and then learning dancing movements which have a healing and revitalising effect on your body and mind, harmonising and balancing your meridians and bringing a sense of uplift, higher energy and joy✨️

We are also working on the elements of nature from yoga and ayurveda. For example, at our last class the focus was on activating water, air and fire elements✨️

You are very welcome to come and see if it is something that resonates with you. It is something new and different and I am sure it can be valuable in some way for each person 🙏

My classes are taking place on Saturdays at 12pm - 1pm in Mind The Step studio in Dublin.

The booking link is in my profile and you can always message me if you have any questions!

"Does this sound familiar? You’re exhausted at the end of the day. All you want to do is relax. But you just can’t seem to sit still and be in the present moment?

Or on a bigger level, you finally plan that vacation to get a break from work. But you can’t seem to relax and enjoy your time away.

When you are in a prolonged state of burnout or chronic stress, it can be surprisingly hard to relax. We know we need to, but we have this resistance to it. That’s because our nervous system gets stuck in this state of fight or flight. We will constantly come back to what is familiar - stress - and resist what is unfamiliar - rest. 

But that doesn’t mean you should give up and just resign to the fact that you’ll be constantly stressed. Change is possible! It just takes time, patience, and consistency. Give yourself some compassion in the process!

"⭐Patient Spotlight - Sheila! ⭐

We really love hearing what our patients have to say about how Chiropractic care has helped them 💚

Sheila say that she feels more positive due to treatment and it helps her stay more mobile.  She feels more like herself and pain doesn't hinder her doing the things that she enjoys.  Her neck is now easier and her legs are less tight and painful 😀

Well done Sheila, see you soon!

"Today is Menopause Awareness Day! 🌸

🪷🌸 Menopause is a natural and inevitable phase in a woman's life, marking the end of her reproductive years. While most people associate menopause with hot flashes and mood swings, there's another aspect that often remains in the shadows: joint and muscle pain. 

🪷🌸 As women transition through menopause, hormonal fluctuations play a significant role in how they experience physical discomfort. Estrogen, the hormone that decreases during this time, has a direct influence on joints and muscles. 

🗣 Come back tomorrow as we share more information about menopause and if you would like help managing your joint and muscle pain during menopause, we have Physiotherapists who specialise in Women's Health who can help you on your journey!

"Reverse Warrior is a side bend done in a lunge position. Yoga has a lot of forward bends and back bends, but a side bend is a little rarer. The intercostal muscles between the ribs are hard to get to but they need your attention too. When going for a side stretch, it helps to reach your right arm up first and back second. The upward momentum toward the ceiling emphasizes the stretch along that side of the body. In a back-bending scenario, you would want to extend equally along both sides. Once you have a nice, long side body, you can start to reach back but you may find you don't actually move very much. You can use this pose as part of a standing pose sequence.

Reverse Warrior Pose opens us up to the world. It is often used as a transition between poses in a Vinyasa Flow class and as such can be overlooked as a pose in its own right. Take care of your neck in this pose. You can look to the floor behind you or to the side instead, especially if you’re holding the pose for longer.

When held for a few breaths Reverse Warrior can give an amazing opening of the side body, releasing tension in the intercostal muscles around the ribs and allowing for a freer deeper breath.
